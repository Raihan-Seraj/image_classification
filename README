The code has been compiled in python and has been tested with python 3.6

**CNN***
To run the convolution neural network, launch the jupyter notebook file and include the path to the dataset in the path section. 

in order to run CNN the following dependencies should be installed

a)Numpy
b)Pytorch version 3
c)Matplotlib

Launching CNN.ipynb saves a csv as an output which can be uploaded for evaluation in Kaggle

**Fully Connected NN**
To run the Fuly connected NN launch the script Feed_Forward_Neural_Network.py. In the code you can modify the path to set the path to the dataset 


**For Launching Linear Classifier** 

Launch the jupyter notebook Linear_Classifier.ipynb. The launching of this file will require opencv to be installed. Since we have processed the data and fed it in with in the notebook script. If one wants to 
avoid processing the data then the path to the dataset can be given to the script and the line corresponding to the processing can be omitted.  


**Filtering**
For launching the filtering code the following dependencies need to be installed
 a) Open CV
